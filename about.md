Hi! I'm Megan. Nice to meet you!

Here are some things you should know about me:

* I graduated with a B.S. in computer science from the University of Southern California. (Fight on!) I had never programmed before I got to college, and I had a really tough time in my first few programming classes. But I kept working at it, and, with the help of some great professors and supportive classmates, I fell in love with computer science. ![USC Logo]({{ site.url }}/images/usc-logo.png)

* After college, I served as a City Year AmeriCorps member at an elementary school in the Bronx. It was a challenging, exhausting, and life-changing year. I absolutely loved it. Ubuntu!

* I'm currently a curriculum developer at Girls Who Code. I've also been an intern at Code.org. I'm super passionate about teaching computer science to anyone and everyone!

* When I'm not programming, I enjoy hiking in the mountains, reading really fat novels, and eating absurd amounts of sushi. I love musical theatre, video games, and spending hours looking at adoptable puppies on pet shelter websites.

* I wanted to start this blog to motivate myself to get back into programming on a regular basis. Since I graduated college, I haven't worked on many side projects of my own. But now that I'm writing CS curriculum all day, I have tons of new ideas for things I want to build! And I'm going to share them here with you.
