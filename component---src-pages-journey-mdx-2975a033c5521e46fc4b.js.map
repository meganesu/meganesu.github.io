But by the time I reached my senior year, I'd decided that I didn't want to be a developer. (In retrospect, that was partially due to a lack of relatable role models and partially because I mistakenly thought developers were just \"code monkeys\" at a giant tech companies.)`}</p>\n    <p>{`Around the same time, I became a teaching assistant for the introductory CS course. I loved helping students progress from feeling completely overwhelmed to gaining confidence in their abilities. I decided to go into education after graduation, because I saw teaching as a way to have a direct impact on people's lives.`}</p>\n    <p>{`After college, I served a year as a `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.cityyear.org/\"\n      }}>{`City Year`}</a>{` AmeriCorps member in New York City, where I supported a third-grade classroom and taught my students how to code during our lunch breaks. After that, I interned on the Education team at `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://code.org/\"\n      }}>{`Code.org`}</a>{`, and then I worked at `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://girlswhocode.com/\"\n      }}>{`Girls Who Code`}</a>{` as a curriculum writer.`}</p>\n    <p>{`While I was at Girls Who Code, I wrote several Women in Tech Spotlights. Each spotlight higlighted the work of a different woman and the way she was using computer science to have an impact in her community. Researching those spotlights introduced me to the kinds of role models I wish I'd had in college. Suddenly I felt inspired to become a developer, so that I too could use programming as a tool for bringing about positive change.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In 2018, I got my first full-time developer job as a consultant at `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.thoughtworks.com/\"\n      }}>{`ThoughtWorks`}</a>{`.
